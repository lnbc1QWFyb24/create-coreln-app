# ROYGBIV

## Introduction:
ROYGBIV creates Lightning prisms, which are BOLT 12 offers that split Lightning payments to different parties at percentages you define.

This repository contains a progressive web app - the frontend component to ROYGBIV. The backend plugin is available [here](https://github.com/daGoodenough/ROYGBIV-backend) and requires Core Lightning with the runtime flag 'experimental-dual-fund.' 

BOLT 12 offers are static QR payment codes that can be reused again and again. Currently, ROYGBIV supports prism payouts to node pubkeys via keysend.

## Challenges:
- Core Lightning plugin local development environment.
- Started on Polar, but ultimately had to move to Docker.

## Coming Soon:
- Functionality to edit existing prisms: add or remove members, change share amounts, etc.
- Support for split payments to other BOLT 12 offers, LNURL, AMP, and Lightning Addresses. 
- Different payout strategies, such as payment amount thresholds and time-based payouts.
